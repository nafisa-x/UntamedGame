!!! The original repo encountered problems, hence this repo was set up to fix the project and also acts as a backup. 
The files have been fixed to show up-to-date assets and code of the prototype, but to view past commits and progress for the past weeks, please refer to the old repository.

How to play
This is a survival RPG, the goal is to survive for as long as possible in an unfamiliar environment with limited tools at your disposal.

Look around by moving your mouse
To move use WASD keys on the keyboard
To sprint, hold Left Shift and move using WASD
To jump, press the Space bar
The game currently contains enemies which will pursue and attack once near enough, if the enemy touches the player, health will be depleted. There is food scattered around the map, walk into them to replenish hunger.

Once the hunger reaches 0, the health will also go down and you will lose the game.

Go wild, untamed child!
